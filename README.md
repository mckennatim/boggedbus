==========

A graphical analytic tool for finding how fast the buses ar moving over different sections of their route.

### Usage

Select 
* bus route
* date
* time slot
then press MapIt

### Purpose
Mayor Walsh and his staff seems intersted in monitoring the state of the city. By knowing how well the buses are moving you get a better sense of how well the city is working. 

While the mayors office does not run the MBTA, having a smoothly running transit system is in the best interests of the city. If one can identify problems with bogged down buses in a particlular section of the city or during a particular time of the day, solutions could be devised to help people move about more efficiently. Solutions for trouble spots might include:
* dedicated bus lanes 
* traffic light timed to the bus location
* re-routing
